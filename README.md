# Psychic Game

Test your psychic abilities by guessing what letter your computer is thinking! Although like a cat, you only have 9 lives. 

## How to Play
To start the game, simply press any letter key. You have 9 chances to press the correct key that the computer is thinking of. If you win or run out of guesses, you can restart the game by clicking "ok" when prompted or hitting Enter. The amount of wins and losses will be logged after each round.
